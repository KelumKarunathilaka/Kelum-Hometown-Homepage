        <h1>Glasgow</h1>
        <p>City, west-central Scotland. It is situated along both banks of the River Clyde 20 miles (32 km) from that river’s mouth on the western, or Atlantic, coast. Glasgow is Scotland’s largest city, and it forms an independent council area that lies entirely within the historic county of Lanarkshire.
        <br><br>Glasgow’s Gaelic name, Glaschu, means “Green Glen.” There is evidence of a fortified prehistoric village on the site, but Glasgow did not begin to develop until about 550 CE with the arrival of St. Kentigern (Mungo), who established a religious community there. The present cathedral, dedicated to St. Mungo and begun in the 12th century, was built on the site of the chapel. About 1180 William I designated Glasgow a burgh of barony, and about 1189 it was granted the right to hold an annual fair. The first stone bridge over the Clyde was built in 1350. Glasgow was created a royal burgh in 1450, and its university was founded in 1451. Glasgow prospered as a market centre because it was well situated between Highland and Lowland Scotland and also between Edinburgh—the capital, 45 miles (72 km) east—and the west. Yet it was not until after the union of the Scottish and English crowns (1603) that Glasgow grew significantly.</p>
    
        <p>Glasgow’s economy in the 21st century includes traditional heavy engineering, advanced engineering and manufacturing, aerospace technology and development (notably the production of satellites), information and communication technology, software engineering, and renewable energy and low-carbon innovations. The city’s BioCorridor brings the public sector, business, and academia together in the research, development, and production of pharmaceuticals, bioinformatics, and medical technology. Glasgow also has a huge retail sector, is a centre of film and television production, and is an important global financial and business services hub. Modern business and industrial estates house many small firms, and others have moved to Glasgow’s new towns. Tourism has increased in importance, aided by the Scottish Event Campus (known as Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre when it opened in 1985), which includes the 12,000-seat SSE Hydro entertainment arena (2013), the 3,000-seat SEC Armadillo auditorium (1997), and the SEC Centre, a complex of interconnected exhibition and meeting rooms.
        <br><br>
        The city is a notable education centre, led by the University of Glasgow (founded 1451). The University of Strathclyde was founded in 1796 as Anderson’s Institution and obtained university status in 1964. Glasgow Caledonian University, founded in 1875, gained university status in 1993. Glasgow’s other postsecondary institutions include the Glasgow School of Art (founded in 1845 as the Glasgow Government School of Design), the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland (founded in 1847 as the Glasgow Athenaeum), City of Glasgow College (established in 2010 by the merger of Glasgow College of Nautical Studies, Glasgow Metropolitan College, and Central College Glasgow), Glasgow Kelvin College (formed in 2013 by the merger of North Glasgow College, Stowe College, and John Wheatley College), and Glasgow Clyde College (formed in 2013 by the merger of Anniesland, Cardonald, and Langside colleges).</p>
